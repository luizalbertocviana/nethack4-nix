This is to build the following source code:

## Introduction

I love this game, and I was willing to learn Nix and NixOS basics, so
it felt convenient to put those toghether and write my first nix
derivation.

In order to use this, clone it, `cd` into the created directory and
run `nix-build`.

I am yet to find a way to integrate this with my `home-manager`
setup. When I do that, I will bring more detailed installation
instructions
